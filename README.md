> Vehicle Routing Problem is essencially an optimization problem. Where we need to find the optimal sets of routes for drivers to tranverse inorder to deliver to sets of customers.

> In our case, problem changes to given sets of drivers and customers, we need to find the sets of optimal routes that will ends up in the same location. 


    Imagine if we all have to goto the same place for an event, and some of us have cars,

    of the vehicle will be the most optimized.
